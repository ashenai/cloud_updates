Today, AWS is launching prompt caching in generally availability on Amazon Bedrock. Prompt caching allows you to cache repetitive inputs and avoid reprocessing context such as long system prompts and common examples that help guide the model’s response. When you use prompt caching, fewer computing resources are needed to process your inputs. As a result, not only can we process your request faster, but we can also pass along the cost savings",

With this launch, supervisors can visualize adherence breaches by agent and day, for up to 90 days in the past alongside their shifts, including the ability to filter out minimal adherence breaches. This visualization allows supervisors to immediately spot adherence breaches across their team, prioritize the most critical incidents, compare with past agent behavior, and take steps to address concerns with the agent. For example, if a supervisor notices a pattern of agents consistently running late to work after breaks or lunches, they can investigate further to determine if there are underlying issues such as network problems, equipment issues, or expectations of timeliness that need to be addressed.
